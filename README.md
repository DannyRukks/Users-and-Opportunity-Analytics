# Dashboard Overview
The dashboard was created to extract information from the opportunity wise and user dataset with the aim of providing comprehensive insights into user activity and engagement on excelerate platform.
The dashboard is divided into two separate pages, one for the opportunity wise dataset and the other for the user dataset. Separate pages were created to enhances user experience by facilitating easy access to different types of information in the dashboard. The dashboard also consists of interactive and insightful charts, navigation tab and dropdown filters  to refine the search criteria.
# Key Decisions and Design Choices
Before the dashboard was created, data preprocessing was accurately in order to ensure the reliability and integrity of the presented insights. Some of the data processing steps taken to refine the dataset involves:
- Removal of duplicates 
- Converting columns to their appropriate format
- Handling missing data in columns. 
- Dashboard wireframe was also created as part of the design choice
# Challenges Faced
One of the major challenges faced was how the information in the dataset will be presented in order to enhance user readability and easy access to the different types of information. After much deliberations with the team, we ended up creating a two pages dashboard for the different dataset.
